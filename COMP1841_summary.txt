COMP1841 Coursework Summary (Condensed but Detailed)

Overview

You must build a PHP PDO + MySQL CRUD web system deployed on either: -
CMS student web server (I-Drive), or
- Localhost (XAMPP).

MySQLi is forbidden → using it caps your mark at 40%.

The system is a mini student Q&A platform (similar to a simple
StackOverflow).
Your job: implement the functional requirements + produce a 2000‑word
report.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Functional Requirements (Core)

Public Website

-   Display a list of questions/posts.
-   Students can add, edit, delete questions.
-   Each post may include an image/screenshot.
-   Manage authors/users (username, email, etc.).
-   Manage module names (add/edit/delete).
-   Posts must be assignable to:
    -   an author, and
    -   a module name (using dropdowns).
-   Provide a contact form that sends an email to the site admin.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Technical Requirements

-   Must use PHP PDO for all DB interactions.
-   Must use a relational database with more than one table.
-   Must demonstrate referential integrity (e.g., foreign keys).
-   Include proper frontend design, consistent across pages.
-   You may use Bootstrap or CSS frameworks.
-   Must include HTML5/JS validation where appropriate.
-   Include basic accessibility considerations (WCAG / W3Schools
    accessibility).
-   You may add extra features for higher marks (login system, admin
    panel, password hashing, validation, etc.).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Legal / Ethical Requirements

You must show understanding of: - Accessibility (WCAG, ARIA, etc.). -
GDPR and personal data handling. - Legal, social, ethical
responsibilities of storing student data. - How GDPR may differ
post‑Brexit. - Must be specific to your system, not generic essays. -
This section must be fully referenced (Harvard).
→ No references = automatic zero for this section.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Deliverables

1. Report (2000 words ±10%) (30%)

Must include: - Title page (URL + any passwords + word count) - Table of
contents - Introduction - Page designs / wireframes + navigation
diagram + ERD - Discussion of technologies (HTML, CSS, JS, PHP, MySQL)
→ Do NOT talk about tools like VSCode, Chrome -
Legal/ethical/accessibility/GDPR section (500 words) - System
walkthrough with annotated screenshots - Formal testing (tables, test
cases, attempted inputs, bugs found) - Conclusion + future
improvements - Harvard references (alphabetical)

2. A ZIP file of:

-   All PHP files
-   Assets
-   Database (.sql)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Marking Breakdown (System – 70%)

-   Display list of posts – 10
-   Add/edit/delete posts – 7
-   Display image – 3
-   Send email – 3
-   Manage users – 7
-   Assign modules/users to posts – 3
-   Manage modules – 7
-   Extra features (login, admin, security, validation, UX) – up to 30

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Marking Breakdown (Report – 30%)

-   Introduction – included
-   Designs/wireframes/navigation/ERD – included
-   Technology discussion – included
-   Legal/ethical/GDPR section – 27% of report section (~500 words)
-   Walkthrough with screenshots – included
-   Formal testing – included
-   Conclusion – included
-   Harvard referencing – included
-   English/grammar/style → penalties for errors (up to −5 marks)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Key Warnings

-   Do NOT use MySQLi (cap at 40%).
-   Do NOT use AI to write your report – must be your own research.
-   Do NOT implement features you don’t understand.
-   All AI-assisted code must be referenced.
-   References must match citations in-text.
-   Avoid synonym/rewording tools.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

What Your Project Should Contain

1.  Fully working CRUD with relational tables:
    -   users
    -   modules
    -   posts (with FK to user and module)
2.  Image upload or display method.
3.  Contact form with PHP mail (or alternative discussed in class).
4.  Clean, consistent UI.
5.  Validation (server-side + HTML5 / JS).
6.  Accessibility basics.
7.  Enough test data to demonstrate all features.
