# **COMP1841 Coursework Summary (Complete + Fully Aligned with Coursework PDF)**

## **Overview**

You must develop an individual PHP + MySQL CRUD website.
You must use **PHP PDO only** (no MySQLi).
Using MySQLi results in a **40% cap**.

The system is a simple student Q&A website similar to a small “StackOverflow”:

* Public list of posts/questions
* Students can create, edit, delete posts
* Manage users
* Manage module names
* Assign posts to authors and modules
* Optional extra features for higher marks
* System deployed on:

  * CMS student web server (I-Drive), or
  * Localhost via XAMPP

You must also produce a **2000-word report (±10%)** and a **ZIP file** containing the entire website + database.

# **Functional Requirements (Core – Must Be Completed to Avoid 40% Cap)**

### **Public-Facing Website**

* Display list of questions/posts.
* Add a post.
* Edit a post.
* Delete a post.
* Display an image/screenshot per post (using the method taught in class).
* Manage authors/users (add, edit, delete).
* Manage module names (add, edit, delete).
* Assign a post to:

  * an author (user),
  * a module name (via dropdowns).
* Contact form to send an email to the system administrator.

---

# **Technical Requirements**

* Must use **PHP PDO** for *all* database operations.
* Must use a relational database with **more than one table**.
* Must demonstrate **referential integrity** (foreign key relationships).
* Must create tables for at minimum:

  * `posts`
  * `users`
  * `modules`
* Must include HTML5 or JavaScript validations where appropriate.
* Must implement **basic accessibility** (WCAG / W3C / W3Schools guidelines).
* The front-end must be **clear, consistent, and easy to navigate** across all pages.
* CSS frameworks like Bootstrap are allowed.
* Must enter enough test data to demonstrate functionality.
* All external code, tutorials, and **AI-assisted code must be fully referenced**.
* Do NOT implement anything you do not understand.

---

# **Legal, Ethical, and Accessibility Requirements (Mandatory)**

You must discuss:

* Accessibility standards (WCAG / ARIA)
* GDPR
* **How GDPR has changed after Brexit**
* Personal data handling and protection
* Legal, social, and ethical issues relating to your system
* Discussion must relate **specifically to your system**, not generic essays
* This section must be **fully referenced** using Harvard style
* **Missing references = zero marks for this section**

---

# **Report Requirements (2000 words ±10%)**

Report counts for **30% of the overall mark**.

Your report must include:

1. **Title Page**

   * URL of the deployed website (I-Drive)
   * Any passwords needed
   * Word count

2. **Table of Contents**

3. **Introduction**

4. **Design Section**

   * Page designs / wireframes
   * Navigation structure diagram
   * Data diagram (**ERD**)
   * Description of relational structure and foreign keys

5. **Technology Discussion**

   * Discuss actual **technologies** (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, MySQL)
   * Do NOT discuss *tools* like VSCode, Chrome, XAMPP

6. **Legal, Social, Ethical, Accessibility, GDPR (≈500 words)**

   * Post-Brexit GDPR differences
   * Accessibility standards
   * How your system stores personal data
   * Must include **in-text citations** and Harvard references

7. **Walkthrough With Annotated Screenshots**

   * Show each page
   * Demonstrate every functional requirement
   * This is **not** the same as testing

8. **Structured Testing**

   * Formal test table (test case, expected result, actual result, pass/fail)
   * Include attempted invalid inputs
   * Bugs are allowed and expected

9. **Conclusion and Future Recommendations**

   * Maximum half a page

10. **Harvard References**

    * Must be alphabetical
    * Every reference must have a matching in-text citation
    * No first-person writing
    * No synonym/rewording tools
    * AI use must be referenced

# **ZIP File Requirements**

Your ZIP must include:

* All PHP files
* Assets (images, CSS, JS)
* SQL database export (`.sql`)
